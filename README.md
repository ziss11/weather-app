# Weather App

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running a Flutter app on different platforms.

## Prerequisites

Before running a Flutter app, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed on your machine.
- Flutter-compatible IDE such as Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA.
- Device emulator or physical device for testing the app.

## Steps to Run the App

1. Clone the Repository
   Clone the Flutter app repository from a version control system or download the source code from a package manager.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ziss11/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
   Use the command line to navigate to the root directory of your Flutter project.

   ```
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. Get Dependencies
   Run the following command to get the dependencies required for the project:

   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Start Emulator or Connect Physical Device
   Start an emulator or connect a physical device to your computer. Ensure that the device is recognized and properly configured for development.

5. Run the App
   To run the app on the connected device or emulator, use the following command:

   ```
   flutter run
   ```

    This command will build the Flutter app and deploy it to the connected device or emulator. You should see the app running shortly after the build process completes.
